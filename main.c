/*
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  The WEB
 * documentation provides more details of the standard demo application tasks.
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "Fast Interrupt Test" - A high frequency periodic interrupt is generated
 * using a free running timer to demonstrate the use of the 
 * configKERNEL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY configuration constant.  The interrupt 
 * service routine measures the number of processor clocks that occur between
 * each interrupt - and in so doing measures the jitter in the interrupt 
 * timing.  The maximum measured jitter time is latched in the usMaxJitter 
 * variable, and displayed on the LCD by the 'Check' as described below.  
 * The fast interrupt is configured and handled in the timer_test.c source 
 * file.
 *
 * "LCD" task - the LCD task is a 'gatekeeper' task.  It is the only task that
 * is permitted to access the LCD directly.  Other tasks wishing to write a
 * message to the LCD send the message on a queue to the LCD task instead of 
 * accessing the LCD themselves.  The LCD task just blocks on the queue waiting 
 * for messages - waking and displaying the messages as they arrive.  The LCD
 * task is defined in lcd.c.  
 * 
 * "Check" task -  This only executes every three seconds but has the highest 
 * priority so is guaranteed to get processor time.  Its main function is to 
 * check that all the standard demo tasks are still operational.  Should any
 * unexpected behaviour within a demo task be discovered the 'check' task will
 * write "FAIL #n" to the LCD (via the LCD task).  If all the demo tasks are 
 * executing with their expected behaviour then the check task writes the max
 * jitter time to the LCD (again via the LCD task), as described above.
